top issue: lag between click and choosing box to show - need to make sure it's the same one

use generator to go through reviews?
	need to go both directions
	store the object globally rather than pass with arguments?
	maybe hoverintent is slow?  has to tell the server that hovering is over?
	or maybe the temporary box is blocking clicking - it seems like clicking isn't possible sometimes
		remove_temporary whenever ANYTHING is clicked?
		but then the user will have to click AGAIN to get the dot
	solution: but the box ABOVE the dot
	allow user to cache business data

let window size be larger if console is open
	maybe also use browser/window size?
